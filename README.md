# Outage-Analysis
UCSD DSC80 Project 4

## Introduction
The Dataset used in this project is Power Outages that occurred in the United States. We were curious if there was a pattern in the power outages that happened, and the question we had in the project is, Where and When do outages arise in America? Answering this question can provide insight into how these outages occur and could prevent them.

The Dataset has 1534 rows and 58 columns. The columns relevant to the analysis were Anomaly Level, Customers Affected, U.S. State, Ind.Customers, Year, Month, Climate Region, and Cause Category. The column Ind.Customers show the annual number of customers served in the commercial electricity sector of the US State.
